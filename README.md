# react-typescript-reward-program

Sample [create-react-app-typescript](https://github.com/wmonk/create-react-app-typescript) using TypeScript and React to showcase some patterns and practices I use when developing apps.


A customer receives 2 points for every dollar spent over $100 in each transaction, plus 1 point for every dollar spent over $50 in each transaction

(e.g. a $120 purchase = 2x$20 + 1x$50 = 90 points).

-  Given a record of every transaction during a three month period, calculate the reward points earned for each customer per month and total.

-  Make up a data set to best demonstrate your solution

Installation:

- `npm install`
- `npm start`
